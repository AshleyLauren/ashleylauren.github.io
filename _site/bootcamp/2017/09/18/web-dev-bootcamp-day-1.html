<p>Today was a <em>good</em> day. I’m officially on a path to becoming a Junior Web Developer. We started bootcamp today. It an intense 12 week dive into web development, courtesy of Awesome Inc.. a tech startup/incubator/educator located in Lexington, Kentucky, and an $11,000 self-investment.
<strong>Web developer bootcamp won’t make you a web developer</strong>
You read it here first. Our instructor, <a href="https://jhempy.github.io">Janine Hemphy</a>, was not shy about this fact: my objective is not to become a junior web developer; my objective is to learn how to learn— a fundamental skill shared by all developers. And it makes sense. In 10 years, perhaps 10 months, most of the technologies we cover in camp will no longer exist, or their future uses will be unrecognizable.</p>

<h2 id="learning-how-to-learn">Learning how to learn</h2>
<h3 id="our-process-involves">Our process involves: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Gaining a ‘thin understanding’ of the tech and digging deeper when needed for specific projects. </li>
  <li>Knowing where to find quality resources needed to learn new tech.<br />
   Cultivating a network of developers. </li>
  <li>Planning objectives and outcomes. </li>
  <li>Building stuff.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technology-used-today">Technology used today</h2>

<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Java Script</li>
  <li>Git</li>
  <li>Git Hub</li>
  <li>Terminal (Command Line)</li>
  <li>Sublime Text 3</li>
  <li>Slack</li>
</ul>

<p>Focus on the objective. Create a roadmap to get from point A to B. Apply the principles anywhere, i.e., How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
